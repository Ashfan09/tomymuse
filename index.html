      Every laugh every late night talk every small moment  they’re all carved in me like my favorite story <br><br>
      I love you deeply endlessly and that love hasn’t faded not even for a second <br><br>
      You stood by me when things weren’t easy and for that I’m grateful in ways words will never fully express <br><br>
      You didn’t just stay  you carried love through storms and I see that now more than ever <br><br>

      You gave me your heart your time your trust and I hurt the very things I should have protected <br><br>
      I know I can’t undo the past but I carry the weight of it with me every day <br><br>
      You were patient loving and strong through it all and I see that now <br><br>

      You carried the weight of this relationship even when I made it heavier <br><br>
      I hurt you in ways I wish I could take back <br><br>
      An apology doesn’t erase the pain but I still need to say it <br><br>
      If your heart ever has space for it I hope one day you’ll forgive me not because you owe it to me but because I want to prove that I can be better softer safer and more human for you and because of you 💞

      I know you hate that you still feel that way because it feels like betraying yourself after everything I put you through <br><br>
      And I don’t blame you for that <br><br>
      I’m not here to beg or to force my way back into your life <br><br>
      I’m just here to love you in the ways I should have before <br><br>
      To be gentle with the pieces I broke and to try in whatever small ways I can to help you heal <br><br>
      Even if it’s from a distance <br><br>
      Because loving you has never been the hard part hurting you was And I’ll carry that until I learn to make it right 🌧️
